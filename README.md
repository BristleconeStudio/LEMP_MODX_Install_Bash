# LEMP_MODX_Install_Bash
This bash script automatically installs a LEMP Stack, MODX Advanced v2.8.1 for setup, creates a database &amp; user for MODX, and outputs the config information you need to enter including the core path. It probably needs more work. Contributions are welcomed and apreciated.
